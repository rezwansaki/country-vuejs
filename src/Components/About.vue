    Hello, I'm Rezwan Saki Alin, designer and developer. I like to spend my days with
    developing websites and mobile apps. I also like graphics and designing too. I've
    worked with some of web developing firms. In leisure time, I like to listen musics,
    reading books, gossiping, etc. I like to watch movies. I'm very much interested
    about science and technology. If you are curious about my works, you could check my
    portfolio. For fresh news and thoughts, go straight to the blog. I'm working anyway,
    as many of my hobbies give me ideas to put into my work. Thanks for visiting my
    website.
